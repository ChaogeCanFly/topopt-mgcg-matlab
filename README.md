# topopt-mgcg-matlab
MATLAB codes for efficient 3-D topology optimization
Codes use multigrid CG, approximate sensitivity analysis, recycling precoditioners

This repository includes matlab codes that were used in the following papers:
1) Amir, O., Aage, N., & Lazarov, B. S. (2014). On multigrid-CG for efficient topology optimization. 
Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 49(5), 815-829.
2) Amir, O. (2015). Revisiting approximate reanalysis in topology optimization: 
on the advantages of recycled preconditioning in a minimum weight procedure. 
Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 51(1), 41-57.

The codes are now freely available, please reference the relevant publications in your research work.

Extensions and improvements are strongly encouraged!!!
